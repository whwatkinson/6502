I was following along in the tutorial and I noticed that the output was not the same.

My initial thoughts.

1. As im using a windows/linux fankastein machine. That somewhere in the config for vasm it was using a different OP code?
2. The arduino was connected incorrectly. 16 address lines and 8 data lines, maybe a bit flip?


I noticed that a data line was not correct by one bit.

         addr_bin            data_bin   addr_hex  r_w    data_hex
Bens     1000000000000010    10001101   8002      r      8d
Mine     1000000000000010    10010101   8002      r      95

A bit flip! See the photo in the folder for physical evidence!
